Most of the end points cluster around the lower values, with fewer climbs reaching higher end points. This indicates that while a random climb can theoretically move indefinitely in one direction, in practice, the steps often cancel each other out, leading to a distribution centered around lower values.\nAfter the analysis we can see that the probability of winnig this particular game is 78.4%.\n","metadata":{}}]}
